I have made a Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python and Tkinter. This classic game involves two players taking turns to mark spaces on a 3x3 grid. The player who successfully places three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins.

Project Overview:
We’ll program the game’s logic using Python.
The graphical user interface (GUI) will be created using the Tkinter toolkit.
We’ll integrate the logic and GUI to make a fully functional Tic-Tac-Toe game.

Setting Up the Game Board with Tkinter:
Ensure you have the right version of Tkinter.
Create a class to represent the game board.


Setting Up the Game Logic in Python:
Define classes for the players and their moves.
Create a class to represent the game logic.
Set up an abstract game board and identify winning combinations.


Processing Players’ Moves on the Game Logic:
Validate players’ moves.
Check for a winner or a tied game.
Toggle players between turns.


Processing Players’ Moves on the Game Board:
Handle player move events.
Update the game board to reflect the game state.
Run your Tic-Tac-Toe game for the first time.


Providing Options to Play Again and Exit the Game:
Build the game’s main menu.
Implement the “Play Again” option.
